    <!-- Lyrics -->
    <p>
        One day in a withered ground<br>
        The rusty air hits me, no one's around<br>
        Hide and holding back, here I am alone<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I see there someone flies<br>
        With the broken wings<br>
        Grant the wind, I should give in<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To someone awaits the night<br>
        Comes to the brighter sky<br>
        Now's the time to letting go<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I trace the future I draw in my mind<br>
        And the rain drains away my sights and the lights<br>
        Tell me is it lonely flower blows at the ground<br>
        Even it's a filled with the ash<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Someday if I can be reached out to you<br>
        To the depth of your heart, soul<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        With the hope<br>
        With the wish<br>
        With the love I forced to give in, and open up<br>
        Come with me<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Haven't seen clear through dim clouds<br>
        But there's shapes I can see but unsure<br>
        Maybe it's the shine I longing for so long<br>
        Longing for so long...<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When the darken lights covers me<br>
        Blow myself everywhere with the wind<br>
        And give away my words and melodies to lighten up the world<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I trace the future I draw in my mind<br>
        And the rain drains away my sights and the lights<br>
        Tell me, is it lonely flower blows at the ground<br>
        Even it's a filled with the ash<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Someday if I can be reached out to you<br>
        To the depth of your heart, soul<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        With the hope<br>
        With the wish<br>
        With the love I forced to give in seize the life<br>
    </p>
